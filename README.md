### 1. Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and its software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did the company want you to address?

Artemis Financial is a consulting company that specializes in creating customized financial plans, including savings, retirement, investments, and insurance for its clients. The company wanted to modernize its operations by securing its web-based application, which is crucial for handling sensitive financial data. They sought to protect their application from external threats and ensure secure communication, especially as they expanded their digital services.

### 2. What did you do well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?

In identifying vulnerabilities, I excelled at conducting thorough manual code reviews and utilizing static testing tools. Secure coding is crucial as it protects sensitive financial data, maintains client trust, and safeguards the company's reputation. Robust software security adds significant value by preventing potential financial losses, legal issues, and damage to brand reputation.

### 3. Which part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?

The most challenging part of the vulnerability assessment was ensuring that the refactored code did not introduce new vulnerabilities. Iterative testing was necessary to validate that the security enhancements were effective and that the application remained functional and secure.

### 4. How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?

I increased layers of security by implementing secure communication protocols (HTTPS), adding cryptographic mechanisms (encryption ciphers), and enhancing input validation. In the future, I would continue to use a combination of static analysis tools, manual code reviews, and industry best practices to assess vulnerabilities and determine the appropriate mitigation techniques.

### 5. How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

I ensured that the code and software application were functional and secure by running a series of functional tests and static analyses after refactoring the code. I used dependency-check tools to verify that no new vulnerabilities were introduced and conducted thorough manual testing to confirm the integrity of the security enhancements.

### 6. What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?

I used resources such as the Maven dependency-check plugin, Java Keytool for certificate generation, and industry-standard encryption algorithms. Adhering to secure coding practices, such as minimizing hard-coded credentials and ensuring data encryption, will be beneficial in future projects.

### 7. Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?

This project demonstrates my ability to:

1. Conduct comprehensive security assessments
2. Implement secure coding practices in real-world scenarios
3. Balance security requirements with functional needs
4. Use industry-standard tools for vulnerability detection and mitigation
5. Clearly communicate technical security concepts in reports

These skills showcase my capability to contribute to secure software development practices in any organization.
